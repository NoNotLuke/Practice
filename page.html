  <p>Once upon a time, HTML and CSS were my second and third languages, respectively. With this project, I hope to regain some of the
    fluency I once had, with some spicy JavaScript thrown in for good measure.</p1>

  <h1 class = 'next 0'>Dream on!</h1>
  <p class = 'next 0'>In the near future, I intend to become able to use JavaScript to perform complex mathematical calculations,
    create event-driven webpages, and even animate elements within my HTML.</p>

  <h1 class = 'next 1'>We don't need no education!</h1>
  <p class = 'next 1'>More and more, I find myself using every free minute to work on coding projects like this one. I really should
    be focusing on schoolwork, but I can't help but find this far more interesting.</p>
  <hr class = 'next 1'>
  <h1 class = 'next 2'>The long and winding road...</h1>
  <p class = 'next 2'>I don't know how I want to live. On one hand, Ayn Rand's captivating portrayal of Howard Roark has had a more
    profound effect on me than I'd like to admit. But on another, I can't help but be frightened by the effect that such a lifestyle
    must have on one's neighbors. As a Catholic and a person, I don't know if these two things can be balanced.</p>
  <hr class = 'next 2'>
  <h1 class = 'next 3'>Duel of the Fates</h1>
  <p class = 'next 3'>Over the next few days, I'm committing to live more like Howard Roark. With the impending due dates in Spanish,
    I need the kind of purposeful determination that he embodies. Once I'm through this unit, we'll see whether it paid off.</p>
